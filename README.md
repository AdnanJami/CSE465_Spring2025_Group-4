## Data Augmentation Technique

The dataset is augmented using **noise addition, and scaling** to increase variability and improve model generalization.

1. **Adding Noise**:  
   - Gaussian noise (**mean = 0**, **std = 0.10**) is added to sensor readings.

2. **Scaling**:  
   - Each sensor value is multiplied by a random scaling factor in the range **(0.94, 1.06)** to introduce slight variations in magnitude.

We merged the original dataset with the augmented one for training.

## 5-fold cross validation result
| Metric                | Average Accuracy | Average Precision | Average Recall | Average F1-Score |
|-----------------------|------------------|-------------------|----------------|------------------|
| Value                 | 81.49            | 80.52             | 81.49          | 80.79            |


## Future Plan

For now we have only used accelerometer sensor data after combining with augmented data from user 4 only so our next plan is use all the other ones and try out approaches such as CNN or RNN to see how it compares with ANN, the one we are currently using.
